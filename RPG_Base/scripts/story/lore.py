hymn_1 = '''Gone are the brave men, none here to stay
Oh, had we found an enlightened way
Wand'ring with no path to find
Gone are now both will and mind
'''

hymn_2 = '''Dead are the brave men, for them we pray
Stilled are their blades, now quiet they lay
Slain were they by shade and sword
Sent to join their mighty Lord
'''

hymn_3 = '''Where are the brave men? Lost in the fray
Minds muddled o'er, now chaos obey
Shattering stars, the moon bleeds red
Out to the night hath now reason fled
'''
final_stanza = ["From the Age of Hope",
'''Death holds but a passing sway,
Joy will come upon His day
