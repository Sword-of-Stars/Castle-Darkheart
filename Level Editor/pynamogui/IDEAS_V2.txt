Ideas for Level Editor 2:

I understand that this library is a quick-and-dirty implementation IOT make progress on my upcoming game, 
Castle Darkheart. However, for future-proofing, scalability, and flexibility, I need to improve the quality of 
the code greatly

Generic:
> Isolate heavy-lifting functions into their own areas to free up the core library, making it more flexible
and user-friendly
> Use css-like scripts to eliminate unnecessary and redundant cosmetic work

Specific:
> Instead of using mouse.get_pressed(), use pygame mouse events to detect unique presses, avoiding
the entire 'just pressed' conundrum
