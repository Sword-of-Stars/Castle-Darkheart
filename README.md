## Story
Venture through the perilous Castle Darkheart in this dungeon-crawler RPG. Battle dangerous foes, acquire powerful abilities, and uncover ancient secrets in a twisted realm ruled by the Mad King.

## Gameplay
(in progress)

## Framework
Castle Darkheart uses Pynamo, a custom framework in Pygame. It's built around my own workflow, so feel free to tinker with it, but it's not primarily intended for distribution.
